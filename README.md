# Ray Tracer
### Homework 2B 
### CMPM 164 Fall 2019

This is a simple ray tracing program written in c++ it currently does not have the ability to take user input. 
To use simply download the .cpp file to a system of your choice, compile and execute. It currently does not take any command line arguments.
While I expect this to work on any system it has only been tested in UNIX like environments after being compiled in g++.
